## Preamble

So, the pretentious name for this recipe comes from the fact that it is essentially a hybrid of both a japanese souffle cheesecake and an american new york style cheesecake, with a spin or two of my own invention. Essentially it's a New York style cheesecake with an unfrothed japanese cheesecake as the filling.

I personally vastly prefer the creaminess of japanese souffle cheesecakes, but also prefer the firmness of american style cheesecakes (plus most of the time I can't be arsed to whisk egg whites) so after some experimentation I came up with this recipe.
I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

Serously, when I came up with this recipe, I spent like a solid 3 weeks straight making a new one right after I finished the previous cake because it's just that delicious.

I find that adding just a bit of brandy just fleshes out the flavour and makes it more sophisticated and complex. I prefer a brandy with raisiny notes, as I think they fit well with the other flavours, but make a choice based on your personal preference.

This recipe was adapted from [Just One Cookbook - Souffle japanese cheesecake](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/new-york-style-cheesecake.html#tabrecipe) and [Once Upon a Chef - New York Style Cheesecake](https://www.justonecookbook.com/souffle-japanese-cheesecake/#recipe)

## Actual recipe

**Recipe makes 1 cake.**

Notes: You can use lemon instead of lime, I personally prefer lime.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>Base</h3>
<ul>
<li>Approximately 125/150g of crumbled butter cookies</li>
<li>5 tbsp of melted butter</li>
<li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
<li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
</ul>
<h3>Filling</h3>
<ul>
<li>300g unflavoured Philadelphia cream cheese</li>
<li>200ml heavy whipping cream</li>
<li>60g butter</li>
<li>155g sugar</li>
<li>5 g of vanilla sugar</li>
<li>6 Eggs</li>
<li>80g flour</li>
<li>The zest of 1 lime</li>
<li>30 ml lime juice</li>
<li>20ml Brandy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method</h2>
<h3>Base</h3>
<ol>
<li>Combine base ingredients</li>
<li>Cover the bottom of your cake dish with the base mixture</li>
<li>Bake at 200 c for 10 mins</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cake</h3>
<ol>
<li>In a large bowl, add 300 g cream cheese, 60 g unsalted butter, 200 ml heavy (whipping) cream, 155 g sugar and 5 g of vanilla sugar. Rest the bowl on the saucepan above the simmering water.</li>
<li>Mash the cream cheese and butter with a silicone spatula. Once they are softened, use a hand whisk to blend everything together. Remove the bowl from the heat.</li>
<li>Whisk the eggs into the warm cream cheese mixture</li>
<li>Using a fine-mesh strainer, sift 80 g flour into the batter. Whisk and blend together.</li>
<li>[Optional] Then, pass the batter through the same fine-mesh strainer into a clean large bowl. This creates a silky texture for the batter.</li>
<li>Add the zest of 1 lime, 30 ml of lime juice and 20 ml of brandy</li>
<li>Pour into cake mould with the prepared cookie base</li>
<li>Bake for 70 minutes at 160 c, with a bain marie</li>
<li>After 70 mins, reduce heat to 150 c and bake for another 10 mins</li>
<li>Allow to cool before removing from mould or serving</li>
</ol>

To test doneness insert a knife or stick into the cake. If nothing liquid and only firm giblets emerge, the cake is done.
