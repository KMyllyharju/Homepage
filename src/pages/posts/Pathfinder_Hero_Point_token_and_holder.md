**Available on [Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/model/1334898-pathfinder-hero-point-token-and-token-holder-param) if you want to print your own.**

I wanted physical hero point tokens to use in my Pathfinder 2e game and was not satisfied with the designs that already existed, so I designed my own. Then I realized that after my game sessions I just had an array of coins on the table and no-one seemed to remember who had how many at the end of the last session, so I designed a holder for them. 

The token holder has a little rounded lip on the top that should stop the tokens from escaping on their own but still allow you put in tokens and take them out with pretty minimal force.

 

The coins are approximately the size of a bottlecap and the holder is only slightly larger than that. More specifically, the coins are 30mm in diameter and 4 mm tall by default however these are parameters in the f3d file. If you change the diameter of the tokens you may need to scale and adjust the debossed designs. (If someone knows how to make the sketches made from vector images scale automatically when you increase the size of the tokens parametrically in Autodesk Fusion, please tell me!)

Both the tokens and the token holder have chamfered edges that make them more pleasant to handle right off the build plate, but as the chamfered edges are all at 45 degree angles, they can be printed without supports.

The f3d file the holder has a sketch that can be edited to add any text you like on the side. If for instance you want to write your name on the side to make sure someone does not steal your precious tokens.

If you want the tokens to feel a bit more weighty and coin-like you might want to print them at a high infill %. (I printed mine at 50% and I like how they feel, but do what feels best for you)

 

The design of the tokens was inspired by KeepGames' design and by the Campaign Coins design
