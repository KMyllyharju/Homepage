**From “The Book of The Son” by Professor Alistair de Vere**

The blooming of a bright star in the constellation of Cepheus will signal the coming of The Son. The beautiful death of this star will tell the world of his birth. At that moment, enlightened men of the world will rejoice, for The New King is born in another world. The child will be born under the light of a dying star, to a lone mother, as a refugee without a star to call home. His first sight will not be of his mother but of that which truly birthed him, the life-essence of a powerful star. The child will be wise beyond his years, and kinder than his human nature should allow, for he will be better, more human than the rest of us. One day, every person in the universe will know the name of the king.

**From “The Book of The False King” by Professor Alistair de Vere**

Beware The False King, for his tongue is silver but his words venom. He will earn your trust, he will make you believe he is righteous, but this is all an elaborate lie. He will plunge humanity into a hundred years of darkness, from which only The New King can save us.

The False King will be a despot at heart who abuses the righteous and rewards the wicked. Yet in the shadow of his arrogance, the fuel of revolution will emerge. This fuel will be set alight by The Son, The Spark of Revolution.

The False King is a wily snake with sight of the past, present and future. Gazing into the core of a collapsing star has given him eyes within time and his vision has driven him mad. He will try to convince you he will save humanity but resist his lies. If The False King fools you, do not worry, for it was meant to be. His words sound like silk yet taste like cyanide. Fret not, look to the skies, for The New King is coming.

**From “The Book of Revolution” by Grand Prophet of the Order, former professor of cosmology, Alistair de Vere**

On the eve of his 15th birthday The Mother shall offer The Son a blade. She shall say “Take this and slay the usurper” The blade will be the new Spear of Longinus for it shall strike down the man who claims to be king. The Son will infiltrate the court of The False King and strike the blade into the heart of the despotic False King. This act will signal the beginning of the revolution. The guards of The False King will throw down their arms, for they know the name of the king.

On this glorious day, the last star of the constellation of Cepheus will shine brighter than ever before, igniting the flame of revolution. On this day it is the task of righteous revolutionaries to ensure every person in the home of The False King knows the name of the king.

**From “The Book of Saint Alred the Wise” by Scribe Stanley Nyobé, Imperial Scribe of Emperor Cezary I**

Emperor Alred IV took his death willingly. He had engineered it just so. He knew he had to fall for the sake of our people. Thus in death The False King became Saint Alred the Wise. The Wise Saint had seen within time and knew of humanity’s peril. He also knew his eyes were dull and could not see clearly. He needed The Son for he could see clearly within time. The Son’s eyes were as old as his eyes of flesh, and just as sharp. Only The Son could steer humanity to a new golden age.

Saint Alred could see humanity was stagnating. Innovation, production, and the development of factors of production had stagnated long ago, and so the system needed to change. This he saw with his vision. Yet his vision was clouded and lacked detail. He could not see what the new system had to be. He knew society and the economy had to change, yet he lacked the vision of what the new system had to be. Humanity needed a leader with mature eyes that granted complete sight. Someone who could see the details of what needed to be.

He knew of the prophecy of de Vere. He knew it was accurate, but unlike The Prophet de Vere, his sight was more complete. He knew The Prophet could only see fragments of truth. Those who believe they know the truth yell the loudest. Those who know the truth know to stay silent. So, in silence Saint Alred worked, to pave the way for The Son. Stoking the flame of revolution so it would be ready when the time came. Saint Alred prepared his court for the coming of The Son and told them to submit to the rule of The Son and to the coming revolution. When the time came, he would invite The Son to his court, to be his heir, to set him up to rule the new world that arises from the ashes of his doomed empire.

Saint Alred looked to the sky and awaited the day when The Son would come and become The New King, for he knew the name of the king.
