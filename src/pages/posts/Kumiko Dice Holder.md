Available on [Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/model/1419196-kumiko-rpg-dice-holder-parametric) if you want to print your own.

A parametric RPG dice holder for 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 2d10, 1d12 & 1d20, decorated with a stylish Japanese kumiko pattern.

I designed this around the exact measurements of my Rime of the Frostmaiden dice set so the fit may not be ideal for your dice set as is. But fret not, that is why I have made the parametric Autodesk Fusion file available for you, so you may tweak the measurements so that your dice fit just the way you like. However do note that by doing so at least in Autodesk Fusion, the alignment of the Kumiko pattern may be messed up, so you will likely need to adjust that. To that end I have also included the vector patterns I have used to help you on your quest.

The holder has 4 slots for magnets to make sure your dice cannot stage a prison break.

Also comes in a square variant for the dice included in the Fallout: The Roleplaying Game starter set.
