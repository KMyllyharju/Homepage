A friend of mine recently started a short Fabula Ultima campaign and wanted me to print some tokens to use for tracking Fabula and Ultima points for the game. Akin to the [Hero point tokens I made for pathfinder](/Homepage/posts/Pathfinder_Hero_Point_token_and_holder)

I wanted to have two very distinctly different kinds of tokens, so I designed some of my own. For the round Fabula tokens I took inspiration from the appearance of Gil in Final Fantasy V and VI.
