### Homo Sapiens

Natives of the Sol system. Inhabiting the third planet of their system, natively referred to as “Earth”. The name Earth very confusingly stems from the same word meaning the topmost layer of the planet in addition to the planet itself. Ironically despite the name of their species “Sapiens” meaning wise, they are categorically the most idiotic of all galactic Homo species. All throughout their recorded history the Sapiens have been completely incapable of longstanding diplomatic relations and have tried to kill one another on a mass scale more times that anyone could possibly count.

The Homo Sapiens are the only species exempt from the general renaming rule, stating that for the purposes of simplicity all Homo species are to be categorized by original solar system. The council made an unanimous decision to allow the Sapiens to keep their self assigned categorization as it was deemed so ironically amusing.

For the comfort of members of the species, all diplomatic meetings with Sapiens representatives are conducted in a large enclosure filled with small rubber balls, also known as a “Ball Pit”.

### Homo Trappist

Natives of the Trappist 1 system. Original homeworld is unknown. The Trappist have retained little recorded history, so much of their history listed here is speculative. It is assumed that the Trappist originate from Trappist 1d, which is natively referred to as “The Garden”. Presumably during a period of great technological advancement the Trappist colonized 1e, “The Plains” and 1f, “The Forest”. At an unknown point in time the Trappist halted use of all previous technology and the inhabitants of all 3 planets built their entire culture around being one with and preserving the nature of their inhabited planets. All Trappist are expected to preform a ritual referred to as “The Journey”. Little is known of this ritual but after completing “The Journey” the Trappist exhibit telepathic and telekinetic abilities.

### Homo Xenos

Natives of the Xenos system, originally from the sixth planet of the system. Known to the natives as “Tuscaloosa”. Mostly a very normal and uninteresting, but they are one of the few Homo species that do not speak common English natively. The language is quite similar to English, but is completely unintelligible. Strangely Homo Sapiens who inhabit the area of “Alabama” on their homeworld “Earth” seem to speak the language fluently, and as such are used by the council as interpreters. it is unknown how such a similarity has occurred despite both being completely different Homo species.

### Homo Norguin

Natives of the abnormally small life bearing planet Norguin 5. As a result of the low gravitational pull of the planet the Norguin are significantly larger than most Homo species on average being taller than 4 meters. The Norguin were at the center of a major intergalactic incident since after the Norguin won the Galactic Basketball Cup 3 times in a row without losing to any team at any point, a proposition was presented to the council to ban the Norguin from competing. Eventually after almost igniting a war, the crisis was resolved. The Norguin founded the Norguin Basketball Association (NBA) with their own league, and whilst not being officially banned from competing the Norguin agreed to abstain from the galactic league out of respect for the game.
