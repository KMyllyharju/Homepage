“When will I get out?” Asked Jason.

“I don’t know, the doctors will be the judges of that. For now just keep in mind that you are completely safe here and we all want to help you”.

Jason wanted to believe what the nurse said, but he couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of dread. Perhaps the nurse knew more about the demons than she let on.

As they walked down the corridor towards Jason’s room, he could hear the screams getting louder. Usually they could be ignored, but now they seemed to get louder, and louder and louder.

Jason stops for a moment and the nurse picks up on his distress.

“Are you alright?” She asks.

“The screaming, it seems to be getting worse” Jason answers, and notices that he is shaking like tiny little leaf in the wind.

“Let’s get you to your room so you can sit down. After that I’ll get you some medicine that will help with the hallucinations”

Jason can’t help but wonder what kind of medicine she’ll get for him. Trying to brush off such concerns, Jason continues walking, but stops in front of a door along the corridor. The voices are screaming so loudly that he can’t concentrate on anything else.

“What is behind that door?” He asks.

“Oh, that’s the office of our head psychologist, Dr. Isaac Asmodeus”

Jason stared at the door for a moment blankly, deep in thought. The voices seemed to be coming from inside the office.

“Let’s keep moving, so you can get settled in.” Said the nurse.

Jason found it to be somewhat difficult to get started with unpacking his few shoddy bits of cloth he had with him. He found himself constantly returning to thinking about the office of Dr. Asmodeus. Could he know something about the voices that were tormenting him?

<br>

“Here you go Jason, here is some medicine.”

The pill looks quite suspicious, but ultimately Jason decides to take it anyway.

As the nurse is about to leave Jason asks her: “Would it be possible for me to speak with Dr. Asmodeus?”

“Generally most of the therapeutic work is done by the nurses, but I can have a word with Isaac and ask if he would be willing to meet with you”

Satisfied with the answer, Jason thanks the nurse and lies down on his bed to close his eyes for a moment.

<br>

The medication seems to make the voices less prominent, but they still scream inside Jason’s head daily. Jason finds it very tiring, and notices he has a harder time concentrating on things than he did before. Just half a year ago he read almost a whole book every week, but now he hasn’t read more than a few pages in the entire time he has been here.

Pathetic.

Many times Jason has wanted to bring these issues up with the doctors, but he’s afraid they will ignore him and just make him eat more drugs. He has put up with it all with the hope that he will get to speak with Dr . Asmodeus, and now it has finally paid off.

Jason stands in front of the door. Standing defiantly against the howl of demonic screams.

The door opens and Jason is met face to face with a well dressed roughly 40 year old man. Yet, there is something off about him. Jason can’t quite put his finger on what exactly is wrong with the man, but something definitely is.

Suddenly the unintelligible screech of tormented souls turns into something far more sinister.

*“RUN. RUN. RUN. RUN.”*

Millions of voices all warning Jason of the immense danger he is in. At last Jason understands that the voices were not a scourge sent to torture the miserable little excuse of a man, but rather a warning.

Now he knew.

He knew and he could see.

See the true face of this vile demon. Red and scarred, oozing blood as if his entire face had been flayed. He now knew he had to run. Run as fast as he could, away from this demon. And so he did.

Yet his escape was halted by a door, obviously it must be the gate of hell. Surely it must open for him. He did not belong here. Or so he thought.

How amusing that such a vile human being could believe they were pure and innocent. Perhaps the demons had come after him for a reason.

“NO! I DON’T DESERVE TO BE IN HELL” Jason exclaimed as the demons surrounded him. No matter how much he resisted the demons outnumbered and overpowered him.

“Let go of me demons! I’m a good man! I don’t belong here!” The demons ignored his cries and carted him off to a torture chamber where they could torment him for all eternity.

“Jason, for your safety and for the safety of others we have to isolate you.” Says one of the vile demons.

“What have I done to deserve this?”

“You are acting aggressively.” The demon was not wrong, anyone in their right mind would defend themselves from a horde of hellbeasts.

“5 mills of Haldol and 4 of Ativan. This should calm you down” As the creature uttered these words and Jason felt the pinch of a needle in his buttocks, he knew that it was all over.

They must have found out that he had not been taking his drugs, but rather hiding them in his cheek and spitting them away later. As punishment they would of course execute him. The demons injected him with a lethal venom that would surely kill him. Nothing more to do than wait for the inevitable.

Jason laid, face down on the floor of the room. Accepting his fate and spending the last few moments moments of his miserable little life listening to the sounds around him. Jason listened to the male voice who narrated his every thought, and at last realized that the voice could be none other than god himself. Yes Jason. I hate you. That is why you are in hell, tormented for all eternity.

### Epilogue

“Do you still hear the voices Jason?”

“Sometimes, the screaming is quite rare but I still hear the narration occasionally. I try to ignore it for the most part, but it’s difficult.”

“Ignoring your own thoughts is occasionally hard for all of us, but I imagine it’s far harder if you hear someone reading you thoughts aloud to you”

“Yeah. Atleast now He… I mean, the voice doesn’t mock me anymore. Maybe I’ll learn to live with it.”
