  <p>I consider myself a true jack of all trades creatively, but I have focused on some avenues moreso than others.</p>
  <p>I have dabbled in semi-professional graphic design and illustration on the 2D side, and on the 3D side of things I have focused on designing functional prints for 3D printing.</p>
  <p>As far as design influences go, I find myself being inspired by the future of the past. Star Trek, Alien, Blade Runner are all major inspirations to me.</p>
  <p>This page serves as a digital portfolio of my design work. Most of them are just things I have made for my own creative fulfilment.</p>
